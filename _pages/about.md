<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Hi there, I am Luona Wang! I am a staff member of the Archives Center of Urumqi High-tech Zone (Xinjiang, China). Before that, I completed my master's degree in Information Science at the <a href="<http://em.swust.edu.cn/#/">School of Economics and Management</a> of <a href="https://www.swust.edu.cn/">Southwest University of Science and Technology </a>. I'm looking for a PhD opportunity. My research interests include data analysis, social media, and HCI.
