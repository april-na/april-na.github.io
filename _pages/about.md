Hi there, I am Luona Wang! I am a staff member of the Archives of Urumqi High-tech Zone (Xinjiang, China). Before that, I completed my master's degree in Information Science at the [School of Economics and Management](https://em.swust.edu.cn/)of [Southwest University of Science and Technology](https://www.swust.edu.cn/). I'm looking for a PhD opportunity. My research interests include data analysis, social media, and HCI.

You can find my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf) here.
